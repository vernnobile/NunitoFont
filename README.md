# Nunito Font Project
by Vernon Adams

Nunito is a well balanced Sans Serif with rounded terminals. Nunito has been designed mainly to be used as a display font but is useable as a text font too. Nunito has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

# Completed tasks:

* Converted project files to .glyphs.
  imported all `old/in-progress/src/*.ufo` files as masters
* Fixed tasks listed in ProjectChecklist.md and internal planning spreadsheet.
* One instance per master.
* Fixed most compatibility.


# Todo:

* Improve README.md
* The weights are not set properly, because there are probably to many masters(8) for Glyphs (?).
  *Probably remove some of the masters:*
  > Light, SemiLight, Regular, Regular, Regular, SemiBold, Bold, Bold, Bold

* Check and fix glyphs, anchors and components.
* Vertical metrics are not correct.
* Kerning, seems there is none. There was minimal kerning in old/in_progress/src ~10 pairs
* Run through Fontbakery and publish.
